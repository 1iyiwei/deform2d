# As-Rigid-As-Possible 2D Shape Manipulation #

The code is from [Ryan Schmidt](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~rms/software/Deform2D/index.html), and I have done some modifications so that the code can be compiled and run with Visual Studio 2017.

See [here](index.html) for the instructions from Ryan.
